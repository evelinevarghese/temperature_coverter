# Temperature Converter

A basic temperature converter web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Temperature Conversion:**
  - Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.
  - User-friendly interface with clear input and output sections.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter the temperature value in the input field.
3. Select the current temperature unit (Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin).
4. The converted temperatures will be displayed in real-time.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to handle the temperature conversion logic. The main conversion function is located in the `app.js` file. The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides styling to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet for styling the application.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file for handling the temperature conversion logic.
